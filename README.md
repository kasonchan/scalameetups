# Scala Meetups

The goal of repository is used to group and document, share Scala and related technologies SBT, Akka, Play, Spark, etc.

A regular (once a week) meetup (interactive talks, pair programming sessions, katas, book-clubs, Q&As) to ask questions/talk/chat/discuss about Scala, meet and network with different people.

Everybody are encouraged to share and give a talk.  

These documents should be easily follow and test and try them out.
