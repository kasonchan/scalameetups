## Akka Actor Basics Tour II

### Kason Chan

---

### This talk was compiled with [tut](https://github.com/tpolecat/tut)

```tut:book
import akka.actor.{ActorRef, ActorSystem, DeadLetter, Inbox, Props}
import com.typesafe.config.ConfigFactory

import scala.concurrent.Await
import scala.concurrent.duration._
```

---

### Recap

* Akka
* Actor Model
* Actor System
  * How to create and terminate it
* Actor
  * An actor is a container for state, behavior, a mailbox, child actors and a supervisor strategy
  * How to handle messages should be processed (Define an actor class and receive method)
  * How to create and kill one in the actor system
  * How to handle incoming message
  * What to do before actor start and after actor is terminated
  * Messages which cannot be delivered are delivered to deadLetters

---

### Recap

* Partial Function

```tut
def receive: PartialFunction[Any, Unit] = {
    case msg: Msg =>
      log.info(msg)
    case any @ _ =>
      log.warning(any.toString)
  }
```

  * A function works for every argument of the defined type.
  * A function defined as Any => Unit takes Any type and returns Unit type.

* Props is a configuration class to specify options for the creation of actors,
think of it as an immutable and thus freely shareable recipe for creating an actor
including associated deployment information.

```tut
val you: ActorRef = system.actorOf(Props[Worker], "you")
```

---

### Actor Lifecycle

<img src="../resources/actor_lifecycle.png" width="50%"/>

---

### Props

* How to create an actor with default constructor values? This is a recommended practice.

```tut
object MagicActor {
  def props(magicNumber: Int): Props = Props(new DemoActor(magicNumber))
}

class MagicActor(magicNumber: Int) extends Actor {
  def receive = {
    case x: Int => sender() ! (x + magicNumber)
  }
}

// Create an actor named magicActor
val magicActor: ActorRef = system.actorOf(MagicActor.props(1), "magicactor")
```

---

### Recommended Practices

* Declare messages an actor can receive in the companion object of the Actor,
which makes easier to know what it can receive

```tut
object MyActor {
  case class Greeting(from: String)
  case object Goodbye
}

class MyActor extends Actor with ActorLogging {
  import MyActor._
  def receive = {
    case Greeting(greeter) => log.info(s"I was greeted by $greeter.")
    case Goodbye           => log.info("Someone said goodbye to me.")
  }
}
```

---

### ActorOf vs ActorSelection

* actorOf only ever creates a new actor, and it creates it as a direct child of
the context on which this method is invoked (which may be any actor or actor system).

```tut
val you: ActorRef = system.actorOf(Props[Worker], "you")
```

* actorSelection only ever looks up existing actors when messages are delivered,
i.e. does not create actors, or verify existence of actors when the selection is created.

```tut
// Select all ActorRef starting with you and send a Hey you message
system.actorSelection("*/you*") ! "Hey you"
```

---

### Send Messages

Messages can be sent to an actor through one of the following methods:

* ! means “fire-and-forget”, e.g. send a message asynchronously and return immediately. Also known as tell.

```tut
val msg: String = "Hello World!"
worker ! msg
i.tell(msg, you)
```

* ? sends a message asynchronously and returns a Future representing a possible reply. Also known as ask.
Message ordering is guaranteed on a per-sender basis.

```tut
case object Ping
case object Pong
import akka.pattern.ask
me ? Ping // Success(Pong)
ask(i, Ping) // Success(Pong)
```

---

### Send Messages

* Replies can be pipe to another actor:

```tut
import akka.pattern.pipe
val result: Future[Any] = me ? Ping
result2.pipeTo(you)
pipe(result2) to me
```

* Messages can be forward to another actor:

```tut
val msg: String = "Hello World!"
worker forward msg
```

---

### Send Messages

* Messages can be set to be sent by a timer:

```tut
import akka.actor.Timers

object MyActor {
  private case object TickKey
  private case object FirstTick
  private case object Tick
  private case object LaterTick
}

class MyActor extends Actor with Timers {
  import MyActor._
  timers.startSingleTimer(TickKey, FirstTick, 500.millis)

  def receive = {
    case FirstTick =>
      // do something useful here
      timers.startPeriodicTimer(TickKey, Tick, 1.second)
    case Tick =>
    // do something useful here
  }
}
```

---

### Terminate an Actor

* Kill message causes the actor to throw a ActorKilledException, triggering a failure.

```tut
worker ! Kill
```

* PoisonPill message will stop the actor when the message is processed.

```tut
worker ! PoisonPill
```

* stop self will stop the actor itself.

```tut:silent
context stop self
```

* stop worker at the application.

```tut:silent
system stop worker
```

---

### Terminate an Actor and Exceptions

* Termination of an actor proceeds in two steps:
  1. the actor suspends its mailbox processing and sends a stop command to all its children,
    then it keeps processing the internal termination notifications from its children until the last one is gone
  2. Terminating itself. (invoking postStop, dumping mailbox, publishing Terminated on the DeathWatch, telling its supervisor)

* If an exception is thrown while a message is being processed, nothing happens
to the mailbox.

* If the actor is restarted, the same mailbox will be there.
All messages on that mailbox will be kept the same.

---

### Supervision Strategies

* 2 classes of supervision strategies which come with Akka: OneForOneStrategy and AllForOneStrategy
  * OneForOneStrategy applies the obtained directive only to the failed child. It is the default strategy if none is specified explicitly.
  * AllForOneStrategy applies it to all siblings as well.

```tut
class Supervisor extends Actor with ActorLogging {

val maxNrOfRetries = 3

override val supervisorStrategy: OneForOneStrategy =
  OneForOneStrategy(maxNrOfRetries = maxNrOfRetries,
                    withinTimeRange = 1 minute) {
    case _: Exception => Escalate
}

...
```

---

### Routing

* We can send messages to a router to efficiently route them to destination actors, known as its routees.
* A Router can be used inside or outside of an actor
* We can manage the routees yourselves or use a self contained router actor with configuration capabilities.
* Akka provides us the following routing logics:

```tut
akka.routing.RoundRobinRoutingLogic
akka.routing.RandomRoutingLogic
akka.routing.SmallestMailboxRoutingLogic
akka.routing.BroadcastRoutingLogic
akka.routing.ScatterGatherFirstCompletedRoutingLogic
akka.routing.TailChoppingRoutingLogic
akka.routing.ConsistentHashingRoutingLogic
```

---

### Routing

```tut
class Supervisor extends Actor with ActorLogging {

  private val router: Router = {
    val routees = Vector.fill(5) {
      val r = context.actorOf(Props[Worker])
      context watch r
      ActorRefRoutee(r)
    }
    Router(RoundRobinRoutingLogic(), routees)
  }

  def receive: PartialFunction[Any, Unit] = {
    case any @ _ =>
      log.info(s"${sender().path} ${any.toString}")
      router.route(any, self)
  }

}
```

---
